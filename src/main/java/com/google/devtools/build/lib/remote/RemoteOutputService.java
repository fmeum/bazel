    /*
    Proof of deadlock freedom:

    As long as the coarse lock is used, there can't be any deadlock because there is only a single
    read-write lock.

    Now assume that there is a deadlock while the fine locks are used. Consider the directed
    labeled "wait-for" graph defined as follows:

    * Nodes are given by the currently active Skyframe action execution threads, each of which is
      identified with the action it is (or will be) executing. Actions are in one-to-one
      correspondence with the ActionLookupData that is used as the key in the fine locks map.
    * For each pair of actions A_1 and A_2, there is an edge from A_1 to B_2 labeled with XY(A_3)
      if A_1 is waiting for the X lock of A_3 and B currently holds the Y lock of A_3, where X and Y
      are either R (for read) or W (for write). The resulting graph may have parallel edges with
      distinct labels.

    Let C be any directed cycle in the graph representing a deadlock, let A_1 -[XY(A_3)]-> A_2 be an
    edge in C and consider the following cases for the pair XY:

    * RR: Since a read-write lock whose read lock is held by at least one thread doesn't
          block any other thread from acquiring its read lock, this case doesn't occur.
    * WW: The write lock of A_3 is only ever (attempted to be) acquired by A_3 itself when it is
          rewound, which means that the edge would necessarily be of the shape A_3 -[WW(A_3)]-> A_3.
          But this isn't possible since the read-write locks are reentrant.
    * WR: In this case, A_1 attempts to acquire a write lock, which only happens when A_1 is a
          rewound action about to prepare for its (re-)execution. This means that the edge is
          necessarily of the shape A_1 -[WR(A_1)]-> A_2. While a rewound action is waiting for its
          own write lock in enterActionPeparation, it doesn't hold any locks since
          enterActionExecution hasn't been called yet in SkyframeActionExecutor and all past
          executions of the action have released all their locks due to use of try-with-resources.
          This means that A_1 can't have any incoming edges in the wait-for graph, which is a
          contradiction to the assumption that is contained in the directed cycle C.

     We conclude that XY = RW. Since the write lock of A_3 is only ever acquired by A_3 itself, all
     edges in C are of the form A_1 -[RW(A_2)]-> A_2. But by construction of inputKeysFor, the
     action A_1 is attempting to acquire the read locks of all its inputs' generating actions, and
     thus the action A_1 depends on one of the outputs of A_2 (*).

     Applied to all edges of C, we conclude that there is a corresponding directed cycle in the
     action graph, which is a contradiction since Bazel disallows dependency cycles.

     Notes:
     * The proof would not go through at (*) if fineLocks was replaced by a Striped lock structure
       with a fixed number of locks. In fact, this gives rise to a deadlock if the number of stripes
       is at least 2, but low enough that disting generating actions hash to the same stripe.
